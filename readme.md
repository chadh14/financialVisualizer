This package provides a python script for generating a stacked line chart of financial data over time. It is useful for creating an aggregate view of a variety of financial accounts.

When transfering funds between different accounts, it can be difficult to track overall performance and net worth overtime. By combining all financial accounts into a single, stacked plot it is easy to see overall financial performance over time. This package enables this type of visualization.

To execute the script run:
`python plotFinances.py sampleData/sources.csv`
